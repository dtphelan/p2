# DWA-15 Project 2

[P2 for DWA-15](http://dwa15.com/Projects/P2). A PHP xkcd-style password generator.

## Project URL

Find the live version over here: [p2.danielphelan.me](http://p2.danielphelan.me).

## Outside code

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used for styling.

The random words chosen are scraped from [Paul Noll's website](http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/). I tried to limit the loading time by only choosing one random page to scrape, but it may still slow the page load.
