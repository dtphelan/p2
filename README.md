# DWA-15 Project 2

P2 for DWA-15. Currently a version that covers the project requirements, with more features/styling to come.

## Outside code

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styles the day.

The random words chosen are scraped from [Paul Noll's website](http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/). I tried to limit the loading time by only choosing one random page to scrape, but that may still slow the page load.

## To Do

- [ ] Spacing options
- [ ] Set default capitalization
- [ ] All styling
- [ ] Extra features, if inspiration strikes
- [ ] Record demo
- [ ] Make the purpose clear
